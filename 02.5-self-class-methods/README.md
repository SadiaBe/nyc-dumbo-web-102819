# Intro to Object Orientation

## Key Questions
✅ What does OO stand for? Is it a Ruby thing?
✅ What is an `object` in the programming domain? What is an object in ruby? What are some types of objects we've worked with before?
✅ What is a class? What are some classes we've worked with before?
  ✅ How do I create one?
✅ How can I create an instance of a class in Ruby?
✅ What's the difference between a class and an instance?
* How can I create instance methods?
✅ How can I pass arguments when I instantiate (create) a new instance?
* What is the difference between a local, global, and instance variable? 
  * Why is it a good thing that variables have scope? 
  * Why shouldn't I use global variables?

## After the break
* How can I define attribute readers and writers using `attr_` macros?
* How can I create class methods?
* How can I call methods on the implicit or explicit `self`?
  
## Maybe
* How can I use OO with the array compositions (`each`, `map`, `select`, `find`) we discussed yesterday?
* Why do we sometimes talk about calling methods as sending messages? What happens if we send a message that our instance doesn't understand?
